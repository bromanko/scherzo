# Add doc comments to public functions in task/source.gleam

Public wrapper functions in task/source.gleam (lines 23-44) have no documentation. Functions like name(), fetch_tasks(), update_status() should explain their purpose and usage.

## Acceptance Criteria

Add /// doc comments to all public functions
Explain what each wrapper function does
Document expected behavior and error cases
