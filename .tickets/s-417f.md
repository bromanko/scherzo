# Add 'WaitingForInput' agent status

Investigate adding a WaitingForInput status to AgentStatus to distinguish between an agent that is actively processing vs waiting for user input in interactive mode. This would help users understand what state their agents are in.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Research if Claude Code provides any signals when waiting for input
- If detectable, add WaitingForInput status variant to AgentStatus
- Update encoders/decoders and UI formatting
- Consider if this requires polling or can be event-driven
