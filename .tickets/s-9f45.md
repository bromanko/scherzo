# Named pipe output routing for agent panes

Implement output routing from agent processes to tmux panes via named pipes (FIFOs):
- Create named pipe per agent in .scherzo/pipes/<agent-id>
- Agent process writes stdout/stderr to pipe
- tmux pane runs 'tail -f' on the pipe
- Clean up pipes on agent termination

This enables real-time streaming of agent output to designated panes.
