# Wire focus command to layout manager

Wire the focus REPL command to actually zoom/focus agent panes via the layout manager.

Current state: The focus command handler exists in commands.gleam but is a stub that just prints a message.

Implementation:
- CommandContext needs access to SessionManager (or Layout)
- focus_command() should call layout.zoom_agent(layout, agent_id)
- Handle errors (agent not found, tmux failure)
- Return appropriate CommandOutput/CommandError

The tmux zoom is already implemented in layout.gleam via zoom_agent(). This ticket wires the REPL command to that functionality.
