# Basic pane layout with control pane

Implement initial pane layout with control pane at top and agent panes below. Use tmux split-window and select-layout commands:
- Control pane: Top row, spans full width
- Agent panes: Tiled layout below (tmux select-layout tiled)

Create PaneConfig type to track pane IDs and their purpose. Control pane should be clearly labeled.
