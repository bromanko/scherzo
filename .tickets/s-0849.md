# Add graceful degradation for tk CLI failures

ticket.gleam directly calls tk CLI functions without fallback. tk CLI errors directly propagate and halt task processing. No circuit breaker pattern.

## Acceptance Criteria

Add retry layer with exponential backoff
Implement circuit breaker pattern for tk CLI
Continue processing even if tk fails (log warning)
Create TkClient abstraction for testability
