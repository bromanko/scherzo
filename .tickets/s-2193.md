# Add command execution timeout

In src/scherzo/agent/process.gleam:160-170, shellout.command() is called without timeout specification. If an agent process hangs indefinitely, the orchestrator blocks forever.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Wrap command execution with Erlang timer
- Add timeout_ms to AgentConfig
- Return Interrupted result on timeout
- Ensure hung agents are cleaned up
