# Ensure workspace cleanup on task info write failure

At process.gleam:103, if workspace creation succeeds but write_task_info or write_claude_settings fails, cleanup may not properly handle all cases. Could leave orphaned .scherzo/task.json files.

## Acceptance Criteria

Ensure proper cleanup in all error paths
Test failure scenarios for each step
Verify no orphaned files remain after failures
