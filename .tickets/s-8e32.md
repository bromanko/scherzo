# Add retry logic for external CLI commands

tk.gleam and jj.gleam make CLI calls with no retry on transient failures. Network glitches or temporary service unavailability causes immediate permanent task failure.

## Acceptance Criteria

Implement exponential backoff retry wrapper
Define transient vs permanent errors (timeout, connection refused vs command not found)
Add configurable retry counts per command type
Log all retries with timestamp and error details
