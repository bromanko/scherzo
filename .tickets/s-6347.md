# Phase 5: Completion Gates

Quality gates that evaluate task completion before merge. When an agent signals done via Stop hook, gates run automatically. Failed gates feed back to the agent for fixes, looping until pass or max iterations.

## Acceptance Criteria

Task completion triggers gate evaluation; failures loop back to agent; passes proceed to merge queue
