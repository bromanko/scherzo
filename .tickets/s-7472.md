# Default to hiding completed tasks

Change the default `tasks` command behavior to hide completed tasks, showing only actionable work.

Default view shows:
- In Progress tasks
- Pending/Ready tasks
- Blocked tasks (with reason)
- Failed tasks (need attention)

Hidden by default:
- Completed tasks

To see completed tasks, user must explicitly use `--all` flag.

Implementation:
- Modify default filter in `get_tasks()` to exclude Completed status
- Ensure `--all` flag overrides this default
- Add summary line at bottom: "40 completed tasks hidden. Use --all to show."

This makes the command output immediately useful for "what needs doing" workflow.
