# Wire REPL to orchestrator

Integrate control REPL with orchestrator and state store:
- REPL actor receives Subject(orchestrator.Message) on init
- Commands dispatch appropriate messages to orchestrator
- Query handlers call state store for current data
- Wire up in scherzo run command startup sequence

Ensure REPL can communicate with all necessary actors for command execution.
