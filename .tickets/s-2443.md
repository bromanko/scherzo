# Split large checkpoint.gleam module

checkpoint.gleam is 486 lines covering checkpoint creation, persistence, JSON encoding/decoding, and file parsing. Mixes multiple concerns that could be separated.

## Acceptance Criteria

Consider splitting into:
- checkpoint_core.gleam (types and core logic)
- checkpoint_persistence.gleam (file I/O)
- checkpoint_json.gleam (encoding/decoding)
Maintain backwards-compatible public API
