# Update help text for tasks command

Update the help/usage text to document all new filtering and display options.

Help text should document:
- `--all` - Show all tasks including completed
- `--pending` - Show only pending/ready tasks
- `--in-progress` - Show only in-progress tasks
- `--status=<status>` - Filter by specific status
- `--tag=<tag>` - Filter by tag
- `--tree` - Show hierarchical tree view

Implementation:
1. Update CLI help in `src/scherzo.gleam`
2. Add `help` REPL command or update existing help output
3. Consider adding examples to help text

Example help output:
```
Usage: scherzo tasks [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --all            Show all tasks including completed
  --pending        Show only pending tasks
  --in-progress    Show only in-progress tasks
  --status=STATUS  Filter by status (pending|ready|blocked|in_progress|completed|failed)
  --tag=TAG        Filter by tag
  --tree           Show tasks in parent/child hierarchy

Default: Shows pending, in-progress, blocked, and failed tasks.
```
