# Improve jj.gleam list.last fallback behavior

At jj.gleam:78-79, list.last() failure silently falls back to using the full workspace_path. While 'safe', this masks errors and could cause incorrect workspace naming. The fallback to full path may not be what's intended.

## Acceptance Criteria

Log warning when fallback is used
Consider if fallback behavior is actually correct
Add explicit handling for paths without separators
Add tests for edge cases
