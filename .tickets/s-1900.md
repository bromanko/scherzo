# Tasks command UX improvements

Improve the `tasks` command output to be more user-friendly and actionable. Currently shows a flat list of 50+ tasks with no structure, making it hard to find relevant information.

Key improvements:
1. Group tasks by status (in-progress, pending, completed)
2. Add filtering flags (--pending, --all, etc.)
3. Show priority indicators visually
4. Default to hiding completed tasks
5. Add parent/hierarchy tree view option
6. Improve blocked task display
7. Update help text for new options

Subtasks:
- s-4ea5: Group tasks by status in output (foundational)
- s-182a: Add filtering flags to tasks command
- s-3529: Show priority indicators in tasks output
- s-7472: Default to hiding completed tasks
- s-71a2: Parse parent field from frontmatter (prerequisite for tree view)
- s-4f6f: Add hierarchy tree view for tasks
- s-63b8: Parse type field from frontmatter (optional enhancement)
- s-52c1: Improve blocked task display
- s-48d5: Update help text for tasks command
