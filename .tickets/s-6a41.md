# Add missing task.new import in orchestrator

At orchestrator.gleam:62, task.new() is called but not imported. The import only brings in types, not the new function. This may cause compilation errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

Add 'new' to the import from scherzo/core/task
Verify compilation succeeds
Add test coverage for task creation path
