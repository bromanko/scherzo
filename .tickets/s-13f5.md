# Add input validation for ticket ID in parser.gleam

The ticket ID field from YAML frontmatter is read without validation in parser.gleam:98, allowing malicious IDs to propagate through the system.

## Location
src/scherzo/task/sources/parser.gleam - parse_frontmatter()

## Issue
Ticket IDs can contain path traversal sequences or shell metacharacters that may cause issues downstream.

## Fix
Validate or sanitize id at parse time:
```gleam
"id" -> {
  let validated_id = workspace.sanitize_id(value)
  FrontmatterData(..acc, id: Some(validated_id))
}
```

Alternatively, validate at the ticket_to_task() conversion in ticket.gleam.
