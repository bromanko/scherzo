# Extend AgentProcess to receive feedback and continue working

Extend agent/process.gleam to support feedback-driven continuation:
- Add message type for receiving gate feedback
- Implement 'continue working' command for same-agent retry
- Support fresh-agent spawn with handoff context + feedback
- Track iteration count in agent state

## Acceptance Criteria

- AgentProcess handles feedback messages
- Same-agent continues with feedback injected
- Fresh-agent spawns with full context
- Iteration tracked correctly
- Tests cover both retry paths
