# Control commands: focus, quit, abort

Implement session control commands:
- focus <id>: Expand agent pane to full screen (tmux resize-pane -Z)
- quit: Graceful shutdown (finish current tasks, don't start new)
- abort: Immediate shutdown (kill all agents, destroy session)

quit should set a 'draining' flag; abort should send Shutdown to all actors.
