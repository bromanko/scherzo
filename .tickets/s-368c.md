# Dynamic pane management

Implement dynamic pane add/remove as agents start/stop:
- add_agent_pane(agent_id) - create new pane, set up output routing
- remove_agent_pane(agent_id) - close pane, clean up pipe
- Recalculate layout after changes (tmux select-layout tiled)
- Track pane-to-agent mapping in state

Handle edge cases like removing last agent pane gracefully.
