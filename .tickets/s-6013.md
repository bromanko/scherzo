# Control commands: pause, resume, retry, kill

Implement agent control commands:
- pause <id>: Pause an agent (signal to stop accepting new work)
- resume <id>: Resume a paused agent
- retry <id>: Retry a failed task
- kill <id>: Kill a running agent (send SIGTERM, then SIGKILL)

Commands dispatch messages to orchestrator/agent process actors. Include validation for invalid agent IDs.
