# Fix off-by-one error in handoff should_fail_task

At handoff.gleam:109, should_fail_task uses >= comparison which allows one extra continuation than intended. With max_continuations=5, it allows 6 total runs (count 0,1,2,3,4,5) instead of 5.

## Acceptance Criteria

Change comparison from >= to >
Or adjust documentation to clarify the off-by-one behavior
Add unit tests covering boundary conditions
