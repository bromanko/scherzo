# Improve blocked task display

Enhance how blocked tasks are displayed to make blockers more visible and actionable.

Current state:
- Blocked tasks show as `[blocked: <truncated>]` with reason cut to 20 chars
- No visual distinction from other statuses
- Blocked tasks mixed in with pending in status counts

Improvements:
1. Add visual indicator: `⛔` or `[BLOCKED]` prefix
2. Show full blocking reason (or link to blocker task)
3. Group blocked tasks in their own section (between pending and completed)
4. If blocked by another task, show that task's status
5. Add `--blocked` filter flag to show only blocked tasks

Example output:
```
=== Blocked (3) ===
⛔ s-1234 Implement auth flow
   Blocked by: s-5678 (in_progress)

⛔ s-2345 Add payment integration
   Blocked by: waiting for API credentials
```
