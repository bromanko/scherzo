# Agent IDs truncated in agents command output

The agents command truncates agent and task IDs, making it hard to identify specific agents. Full IDs like agent-task-1769180780682481241-1769180780685 display as agent-task-1. Should either show full IDs, truncate with unique suffix, or use shorter unique format. Likely in src/scherzo/ui/commands.gleam.
