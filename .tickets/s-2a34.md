# Extend event.gleam with gate event variants

Extend event.gleam with GateEvent variants:
- TaskCompletionSignaled(task_id, checkpoint)
- GateEvaluationStarted(task_id, iteration)
- GateCompleted(task_id, gate_name, result)
- AllGatesPassed(task_id, iteration)
- GateFailedRetrying(task_id, gate_name, feedback, iteration)
- GateFailedMaxIterations(task_id, feedback, iterations)
- HumanReviewRequested(task_id, prompt)
- HumanReviewCompleted(task_id, approved, comment)

## Acceptance Criteria

- GateEvent variants added to event.gleam
- EventBus can route gate events
- Events serializable for logging
- Tests cover event creation and routing
