# Parse type field from ticket frontmatter

Add support for parsing the `type` field (task, epic, bug, etc.) from ticket frontmatter.

Current state:
- Tickets have `type: task` or `type: epic` in frontmatter
- Parser ignores this field entirely
- No way to distinguish epics from tasks in output

Implementation:
1. Add `TicketType` enum to `parser.gleam`: `Task | Epic | Bug | Feature`
2. Add `ticket_type: TicketType` to `ParsedTicket` type
3. Parse `type:` field in `parse_frontmatter()`, default to `Task`
4. Optionally expose on `Task` type or keep parser-level only

Benefits:
- Tree view can show epics differently (bold, icon, etc.)
- Filtering by type becomes possible (`--epics`, `--bugs`)
- Better visual hierarchy in task lists
