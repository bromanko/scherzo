# Fix silent error in orchestrator update_change_on_completion

At orchestrator.gleam:141, the result of update_change_on_completion is discarded with 'let _'. If jj fails, the error is never reported or logged.

## Acceptance Criteria

Handle or log the error from update_change_on_completion
Add warning message when jj change update fails
Ensure task processing continues but failure is visible
