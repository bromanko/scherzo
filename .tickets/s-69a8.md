# Implement multi-pass review gate

Create gates/multipass.gleam for sequential Rule of Five review:
- Run passes in order: Draft, Correctness, Clarity, Edge Cases, Excellence
- Each pass can modify code (agent makes fixes)
- Stop when agent signals CONVERGED
- Track which passes completed
- Configurable max passes

## Acceptance Criteria

- gates/multipass.gleam exists
- Runs passes sequentially
- Detects CONVERGED signal
- Respects max passes limit
- Returns all findings from all passes
- Tests cover convergence detection
