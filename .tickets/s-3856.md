# Add unit tests for task/source.gleam

The task source module defines the TaskSource interface and provides wrapper functions but has no test coverage. Focus on testing interface wrapper functions and verifying the interface contract.

## Acceptance Criteria

Test wrapper functions correctly delegate to implementation
Test interface can be implemented by test double
Verify interface contract is properly defined
