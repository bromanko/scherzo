# Split orchestrator.gleam into supervisor and coordinator modules

Refactor orchestrator.gleam into orchestrator/supervisor.gleam (supervision tree) and orchestrator/coordinator.gleam (work coordination, gate triggering). This clean separation prepares for gate integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- orchestrator/supervisor.gleam contains supervision tree logic
- orchestrator/coordinator.gleam contains work coordination
- All existing tests pass
- No behavior changes from user perspective
