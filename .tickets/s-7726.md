# Add unit tests for agent/process.gleam

The agent process module manages the agent actor lifecycle including starting tasks, workspace management, and status reporting but has no test coverage. Functions to test: start(), start_task(), get_status(), handle_start().

## Acceptance Criteria

Test start() creates actor that responds to messages
Test start_task() transitions agent to running state
Test get_status() returns correct status at each lifecycle phase
Test workspace is created when task starts
Test workspace is destroyed when task completes
Test agent handles driver completion correctly
Test agent handles driver failure correctly
Test graceful shutdown behavior
