# Extend task.gleam with gate-related task phases

Extend task.gleam TaskPhase type with new states for gate evaluation:
- Working(agent_id, iteration) - agent actively working
- Evaluating(agent_id, iteration, gate_index) - gates being evaluated
- NeedsFixes(agent_id, iteration, feedback) - gate failed, feedback sent
- GatesPassed(agent_id, completed_at) - all gates passed
- Stuck(agent_id, iterations, last_feedback) - max iterations exceeded
- Failed(reason) - terminal failure

## Acceptance Criteria

- TaskPhase type extended
- All existing code updated for new variants
- State transitions documented
- Tests updated
