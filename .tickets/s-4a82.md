# Implement gate executor main loop

Create gates/executor.gleam with the main gate execution loop:
- Load gate config
- Run gates in order
- Collect results
- Handle pass/fail transitions
- Always restart from beginning on retry (per design decision)

Key function: execute(task_id, workspace_path) -> Result(GateResult, GateError)

## Acceptance Criteria

- gates/executor.gleam exists
- Runs gates sequentially
- Collects all results before returning
- Emits appropriate events
- Handles errors gracefully
- Unit tests cover execution flow
