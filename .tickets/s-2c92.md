# Remove duplicate code across modules

Audit the codebase for duplicated functions and extract them to shared modules. Known example: update_change_on_completion is duplicated in both process.gleam:239-282 and orchestrator.gleam:245-275 with nearly identical logic. This should be extracted to a shared location (e.g., scherzo/vcs/jj.gleam or scherzo/agent/common.gleam).
