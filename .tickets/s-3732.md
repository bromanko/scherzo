# Implement feedback builder

Create gates/feedback.gleam to format gate findings for agent consumption:
- Group findings by priority (P0, P1, P2)
- Include file:line locations
- Add suggested fixes
- Format for agent prompt injection

Output should be clear, actionable feedback the agent can use to fix issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- gates/feedback.gleam exists
- Formats findings clearly with priority grouping
- Includes actionable suggestions
- Same format works for same-agent and fresh-agent
- Unit tests cover formatting edge cases
