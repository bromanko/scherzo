# Implement synthesis gate

Create gates/synthesis.gleam to combine review findings:
- Receive findings from all parallel reviewers
- Deduplicate overlapping issues
- Prioritize by severity (P0 > P1 > P2 > P3)
- Generate unified review summary
- Determine pass/fail (fail if any P0 or P1)

## Acceptance Criteria

- gates/synthesis.gleam exists
- Dedupes similar findings
- Sorts by priority
- Clear summary output
- Pass/fail logic correct
- Tests cover deduplication and prioritization
