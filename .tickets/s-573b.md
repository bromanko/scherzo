# Implement human approval gate

Create gates/human.gleam for human approval checkpoints:
- Notify control pane that approval is needed
- Display diff summary and any previous gate feedback
- Block indefinitely until human responds (per design decision)
- Handle approve/reject/comment responses
- If rejected with comment, treat as gate failure with feedback

## Acceptance Criteria

- gates/human.gleam exists
- Sends notification to control pane
- Blocks until response received
- Handles approve/reject correctly
- Comment on reject becomes feedback
- Integration test with mock REPL
