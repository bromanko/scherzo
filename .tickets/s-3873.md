# Integration tests for tmux UI

Write integration tests that verify the full tmux UI flow:
- Session creation and destruction
- Pane layout setup
- Output routing via pipes
- Command dispatch to orchestrator
- Dynamic pane management

Tests require tmux to be available. Use test helpers to create/destroy test sessions. Clean up sessions in test teardown.
